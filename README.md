## Using Skills with Claude Web

The `.dist` folder contains individual skill zip files ready for upload to Claude web (claude.ai). Each skill is packaged as a separate zip file that can be uploaded independently to the skills section in your Claude web conversations.

### Generating Skill Zips

Run the packaging script from the repository root:

```bash
# Create individual skill zips in .dist directory
go run scripts/package-skills.go

# This creates files like:
# .dist/commit-messages.zip
# .dist/react.zip
# .dist/swift-testing.zip
# etc.
```

### Uploading to Claude Web

1. Visit [claude.ai](https://claude.ai)
2. Navigate to the skills section
3. Upload the individual zip files from `.dist`
4. Access the skills in your web conversations

See [scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md) for more options including custom output directories and skill name prefixing.

### Syncing to Codex CLI

Skills can also be synced to the OpenAI Codex CLI format, making them available for use with Codex.

Run the sync script from the repository root:

```bash
# Sync all skills to ~/.codex/skills (user-level)
go run scripts/codex-sync.go

# Sync to .codex/skills in current project (project-level)
go run scripts/codex-sync.go --project

# This syncs skills like:
# commit-messages
# react
# swift-testing
# etc.
```

After syncing, invoke skills in Codex CLI using the `$skill-name` syntax (e.g., `$commit-messages`, `$react`).

See [scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md) for more options including custom output directories, skill name prefixing, and dry-run mode.
