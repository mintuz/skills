# Claude Plugin Skills Tools

This directory contains tools for working with Claude plugin skills across different platforms.

## Overview

This directory contains two main tools:

1. **`package-skills.go`** - Packages skills into a zip file for uploading to Claude web (claude.ai)
2. **`codex-sync.go`** - Syncs skills to OpenAI Codex CLI format

**IMPORTANT:** Run these scripts from the repository root directory, not from within the `scripts/` directory.

## Evaluate Skills

Skill evaluations use [Promptfoo](https://www.promptfoo.dev/). Each suite compares
the current skill with a no-skill baseline over realistic behavioural scenarios.

```bash
# Install the pinned evaluator
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

# Validate configuration without model calls
pnpm eval:skills:check

# Run every skill regression as a test
pnpm test:skills

# Compare every baseline and skill side by side
pnpm eval:skills

# Filter any command to one skill
pnpm eval:skills:check -- commit-messages
pnpm test:skills -- commit-messages
pnpm eval:skills -- commit-messages

# Open the local results UI
pnpm eval:skills:view
```

Treatment prompts read the current skill `SKILL.md`, so edits need no fixture
update. An isolated Codex judge scores each response against the case rubric.
The `test:skills` command runs only treatments with a 0.8 gate; the full comparisons
report baseline and treatment side by side and are informational.

Promptfoo and its reports run locally, but this configuration sends the skill and
scenario text to the model behind the existing Codex login. Change the provider to
a local agent/model when inference must stay on the machine.

This suite tests behaviour after activation. Add disposable `.agents/skills/`
fixtures and Promptfoo's `skill-used` assertion when testing trigger selection.
Use `skill-doctor` separately to find trigger problems in real conversation history.

## Package Skills for Claude Web

The `package-skills.go` script creates individual zip files for each skill from the marketplace, ready to upload to the Claude web interface at claude.ai.

### Why Use This?

Upload the packaged skills to Claude web to access all plugin skills directly in your browser sessions without needing Claude Code CLI. Each skill is packaged as a separate zip file that can be uploaded independently.

### Quick Start

Run these commands from the repository root:

```bash
# Create individual zip files in .dist directory (default)
go run scripts/package-skills.go

# Create zip files in a custom directory
go run scripts/package-skills.go --output ~/my-skills

# Validate skills without creating zip files (dry run)
go run scripts/package-skills.go --dry-run --verbose
```

### Usage

```bash
go run scripts/package-skills.go [flags]
```

### Flags

| Flag                   | Description                                      | Default                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `--output <dir>`       | Output directory for skill zip files             | `.dist`                             |
| `--marketplace <file>` | Path to marketplace.json                         | `./.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` |
| `--prefix`             | Prefix skill names with plugin name              | `false`                             |
| `--verbose`            | Enable verbose logging                           | `false`                             |
| `--dry-run`            | Validate without creating zip files              | `false`                             |

### Examples

#### Create zip files in default .dist directory

```bash
go run scripts/package-skills.go
# Creates: .dist/commit-messages.zip, .dist/react.zip, etc.
```

#### Create zip files in custom directory

```bash
go run scripts/package-skills.go --output ~/Downloads/claude-skills
```

#### Prefix skill names with plugin name

```bash
go run scripts/package-skills.go --prefix
# Creates: .dist/core-commit-messages.zip, .dist/web-react.zip, .dist/app-swift-testing.zip, etc.
```

#### Verbose dry run

```bash
go run scripts/package-skills.go --dry-run --verbose
```

### How It Works

1. **Reads marketplace.json** - Discovers all plugins and their skills
2. **Validates skills** - Ensures each skill has required SKILL.md file
3. **Creates individual zips** - Each skill packaged in its own zip file with optional plugin prefix
4. **Packages files** - Recursively adds all skill files to each zip
5. **Reports statistics** - Shows skills packaged, files added, and zip files created

### Using Packaged Skills

1. Run the script to create individual zip files in the `.dist` directory
2. Visit claude.ai
3. Upload each zip file individually in the skills section
4. Access the skills in your web conversations

## Sync Skills to Codex CLI

The `codex-sync.go` script converts and copies skills from the Claude plugin marketplace to the Codex skills format, making them available for use in OpenAI's Codex CLI.

## Quick Start

Run these commands from the repository root:

```bash
# Sync all skills to ~/.codex/skills (user-level)
go run scripts/codex-sync.go

# Sync to .codex/skills in current project (project-level)
go run scripts/codex-sync.go --project

# Dry run to see what would be synced
go run scripts/codex-sync.go --dry-run --verbose
```

## Installation

### Build the binary

From the repository root:

```bash
go build -o codex-sync scripts/codex-sync.go
```

### Run directly with go run

From the repository root:

```bash
go run scripts/codex-sync.go [flags]
```

## Usage

```bash
codex-sync [flags]
```

### Flags

| Flag                   | Description                                       | Default                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `--output <dir>`       | Custom output directory for Codex skills          | `~/.codex/skills`                   |
| `--plugins <dir>`      | Directory containing Claude plugins               | `./src`                             |
| `--marketplace <file>` | Path to marketplace.json                          | `./.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` |
| `--project`            | Install to `.codex/skills` in current directory   | `false`                             |
| `--prefix`             | Prefix skill names with plugin name               | `false`                             |
| `--verbose`            | Enable verbose logging                            | `false`                             |
| `--dry-run`            | Show what would be synced without modifying files | `false`                             |

## Examples

### User-level installation (default)

Installs skills to `~/.codex/skills` for all your Codex sessions. Run from repository root:

```bash
go run scripts/codex-sync.go
```

### Project-level installation

Installs skills to `.codex/skills` in the current repository. Run from repository root:

```bash
go run scripts/codex-sync.go --project
```

### Custom output directory

Run from repository root:

```bash
go run scripts/codex-sync.go --output /path/to/custom/skills
```

### Verbose dry run

See exactly what would be synced without making changes. Run from repository root:

```bash
go run scripts/codex-sync.go --dry-run --verbose
```

### Sync specific marketplace file

Run from repository root:

```bash
go run scripts/codex-sync.go --marketplace /path/to/marketplace.json
```

## How It Works

1. **Reads marketplace.json** - Discovers all plugins and their skills
2. **Finds skill directories** - Locates each skill's SKILL.md and supporting files
3. **Creates flat structure** - Skills use their original names (e.g., `commit-messages`, `react`) or prefixed names with `--prefix` flag
4. **Copies files** - Recursively copies all skill files to the target directory
5. **Maintains structure** - Preserves directory structure within each skill folder

**Note:** Changes to source skills require re-running the sync to update the copied files in Codex.

## Skill Naming Convention

By default, skills are synced with their original names (flattened structure without plugin prefix):

| Claude Plugin Skill    | Codex Skill Name (default) | With `--prefix` flag   |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `core:commit-messages` | `commit-messages`          | `core-commit-messages` |
| `web:react`            | `react`                    | `web-react`            |
| `app:swift-testing`    | `swift-testing`            | `app-swift-testing`    |

**Note:** All skill names are unique across plugins, so no conflicts occur with the flattened structure.

## Using Synced Skills in Codex

After syncing, you can use skills in Codex CLI:

```bash
# Invoke a skill explicitly (using default flattened names)
$commit-messages
$react
$swift-testing

# Or with --prefix flag enabled
$core-commit-messages
$web-react
$app-swift-testing

# Let Codex auto-select based on context
# Just describe what you need and Codex will use the appropriate skill
```

## Supported Skill Features

The sync tool preserves all skill features:

- ✅ SKILL.md with YAML frontmatter
- ✅ Reference documentation files
- ✅ Scripts and executables
- ✅ Resource files and assets
- ✅ Nested directory structures

## Skills Synced

Based on the current marketplace configuration, the following skills will be synced (shown with default flattened names):

### Core Plugin

- `commit-messages` - Git/conventional commit message guidance
- `yagni` - Minimum sufficient execution, scope boundaries, and engineering standards
- `learn` - Learning and knowledge building
- `pr` - Pull request creation and review
- `writing` - Technical writing guidance
- `wtf` - Re-explain unclear responses in plain, precise UK English

### Web Plugin

- `css` - CSS best practices and modern patterns
- `tdd` - Test-driven development for web apps
- `react` - React architecture and patterns
- `xstate` - Typed actor lifecycles with Mermaid statechart visualization
- `react-testing` - React testing strategies
- `frontend-testing` - Frontend testing approaches
- `web-design` - Web design principles
- `eyes` - Visual design and UI review
- `chatgpt-app-sdk` - ChatGPT app SDK integration

### App Plugin

- `swift-testing` - Swift testing with Swift Testing framework
- `app-intent-driven-development` - App Intent-first iOS development
- `swiftui-architecture` - SwiftUI architecture patterns
- `debug` - iOS debugging techniques

### Product Management Plugin

- `status-updates` - Status update creation and formatting

### Life Plugin

- `gps-method` - Personal goal achievement methodology

**Note:** Use the `--prefix` flag to add plugin prefixes (e.g., `core-commit-messages` instead of `commit-messages`)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues (Both Scripts)

#### "SKILL.md not found" error

Ensure the skill directory exists and contains a SKILL.md file:

```bash
ls -la src/core/skills/commit-messages/
```

#### Skills have no content or missing files

Verify the marketplace.json correctly references skill paths:

```bash
cat .claude-plugin/marketplace.json | grep -A 5 "skills"
```

### Package Skills Issues

#### "Permission denied" when creating zip files

Ensure you have write permissions to the output directory:

```bash
# Check current directory permissions
ls -la .

# Or specify a directory where you have write access
go run scripts/package-skills.go --output ~/Downloads/claude-skills
```

#### Zip files are empty or incomplete

Run with verbose flag to see what's being packaged:

```bash
go run scripts/package-skills.go --dry-run --verbose
```

#### Output directory not created

The script automatically creates the output directory if it doesn't exist. If you see errors, ensure the parent directory exists and you have write permissions.

### Codex Sync Issues

#### "Permission denied" when creating directories

Ensure you have write permissions to the target directory:

```bash
# For user-level install
chmod 755 ~/.codex

# For project-level install
chmod 755 .codex
```

#### Skills not appearing in Codex

1. Verify the sync completed successfully
2. Check the output directory contains the skills:
   ```bash
   ls -la ~/.codex/skills/
   ```
3. Restart your Codex CLI session

## Development

### Project Structure

```
scripts/
├── package-skills.go   # Package skills to zip for Claude web
├── codex-sync.go       # Sync skills to Codex CLI
├── go.mod              # Go module definition
└── README.md           # This file
```

### Code Structure

Both scripts share similar architecture:

**package-skills.go:**
- `main()` - CLI argument parsing and orchestration
- `readMarketplace()` - Parses marketplace.json
- `createSkillsZip()` - Creates and manages zip archive
- `packagePlugin()` - Packages all skills for a plugin
- `packageSkill()` - Adds individual skill to zip
- `addFileToZip()` - Adds files to zip with compression

**codex-sync.go:**
- `main()` - CLI argument parsing and orchestration
- `readMarketplace()` - Parses marketplace.json
- `syncPlugin()` - Syncs all skills for a plugin
- `syncSkill()` - Syncs individual skill directory
- `copyFile()` - Copies files with permissions

### Testing

Run dry runs to test without modifying files. From repository root:

```bash
# Test package-skills.go (zip packaging)
go run scripts/package-skills.go --dry-run --verbose

# Test codex-sync.go (Codex sync)
go run scripts/codex-sync.go --dry-run --verbose
```
